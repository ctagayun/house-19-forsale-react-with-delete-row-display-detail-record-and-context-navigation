 useEffect hook - whenever we use something that's outside the realm of React
  such API interaction, timer interactions, etc gives unpredictable results because it is 
  not PURE FUNCTION. For example api might not be available or 
  encounter error, we need to handle side-effects by useEffect hook.
    To perform an effect in the function component, React automatically 
  runs useEffect hook after running the components pure function and 
  the browser has been updated. 

    useEffect takes functions as paameters. In the fucntion, the effect 
  is performed. For example we can fetch data from an API for example

Current Task:
   - added housedetail component
   - display housedetail component when click from houselist
      https://app.pluralsight.com/ilx/video-courses/9a3771fa-626e-4708-8634-c49cc8616922/2e8c1f61-a9fa-48be-9e6c-4636fc0e17e1/95d8a52b-12fc-4acb-937b-e886c968d9b3
   - set another state to display HouseDetail:
       const [selectedHouse, setSelectedHouse] = useState(); 

===============================================
Previous Task: Using Reducer Hook
  
Interview Questions ReducerHook:
  Question: What is useReducer in React?
    Answer: useReducer is a React hook that manages complex 
    state logic in function components by dispatching actions 
    to update state.
      
  Question: How does useReducer differ from useState in React?
    Answer: While useState is simpler for managing individual 
    state variables, useReducer is more suitable for complex state 
    logic where multiple values depend on each other.

  Question: What is the basic structure of the useReducer hook?
    Answer: It returns the current state and a dispatch function 
    for triggering state updates, taking a reducer function and 
    an initial state as arguments.

  Question: What is a reducer function in useReducer?
    Answer: The reducer function is responsible for specifying how 
    the state should change in response to dispatched actions, 
    based on the current state and the action. Reducer function 
    is an argument to ReducerDispatch()

  Question: How is state updated using useReducer?
    Answer: State is updated by dispatching actions, and the reducer 
    function determines the new state based on the current state 
    and the action type.

  Question: Can useReducer replace all use cases of useState in React?
    Answer: While useReducer is powerful, it's not necessary for 
    all scenarios. useState is simpler and more suitable for managing 
    individual state variables. 

====================================================
Prev  Task: - show a loading indicator
     In order to show a loading indicator, one would need to introduce 
     a new stateful value. A boolean called isLoading may be the best solution.

     - When the side-effect which loads the data kicks in, set the stateful 
     boolean to true. Once the data loaded, set the stateful boolean to 
     false again.

     - In JSX, show a "Loading ..." text conditionally when the isLoading 
     boolean is set to true.

===================================================
Prev Task: Inline Handler in JSX:
  Task: The application renders a list of items and allows 
its users to filter the list via a search feature. Next the 
application should render a button next to each list item 
which allows its users to remove the item from the list.
  Optional Hints:

   -The list of items needs to become a stateful value 
   (here: stateful array) with useState in order to manipulate 
   it (e.g. removing an item) later.

   - Every list item renders a button with a click handler. 
   When clicking the button, the item gets removed from the 
   list by manipulating the state.

   - Since the stateful list resides in the App component, 
    one needs to use callback handlers to enable the Item 
    component to communicate up to the App component for 
    removing an item by its identifier.
===============================================================
 Previous Task: Side Effect    
    Note: Whenever we use something that's outside the realm of React
  such API interaction gives unpredictable results because it is 
  not PURE FUNCTION. For example api might not be available or 
  encounter error, we need to handle side-effects by useEffect hook.

    This exercise will implement a feature that will enable Search component
 to remember the most recent searched. 

    Let's implement this feature by using a side-effect to store the recent search 
 from the browser's local storage and retrieve it upon the initial component 
 initialization. First, use the local storage to store the searchTerm accompanied
  by an identifier whenever a user types into the HTML input field:

   What is useEffect?
      - Use useEffect Hook to trigger the desired side-effect each time 
     the searchTerm changes:

      - Use effect automatically runs after React completes running
      the component pure functions and the browser has been updated.
      In the function the "EFFECT" is performed. So we can fetch data
      from an API for example.
 ==============================================================
 Previous Task: React Controlled Components Task:
    - we modified the Search component. We added the value attribute
      
    <div className="float-start ">
            <label htmlFor="search">Search:</label>
            <input id="search" 
              value={props.search} <-- We added the value attribute
              type="text"
              onChange={props.onSearch}/> 
            <p> 
              Searching for <strong>{props.search}</strong>
            </p>
        </div>
    
    Here we added a "value" attribute instead of giving the 
    html element the freedom of keeping track of its internal state.
    Instead React uses state by leveraging the "value" attribute.
    Whenever the HTML search ox element emits change event the NEW VALUE 
    is WRITTEN to React states and RE-RENDERS the component. Then
    the HTML element uses the recent state as value again.
    
    - As a result because of the "value" attribute the input textbox 
      became EXPLICITLY controlled element and Search component became 
      IMPLICITLY a controlled component.

    Interview Questions:
      Question 1: What is a controlled component in React?
        Answer: A controlled component is a component whose 
               FORM elements are controlled by React state. 
                 
      Question 2: How do you create a controlled input in React?
       Answer: Set the input VALUE attribute to a state variable 
       and provide an onChange handler to update the state.

      Question 3: What is the role of the value prop in a controlled input element?
       Answer: The value prop sets the current value of the input, 
       making it a controlled component.

      Question 4: How do you handle a controlled checkbox in React?
         Answer: Use the checked attribute and provide an 
         onChange handler to update the corresponding state.

      Question 5: How do you clear the value of a controlled component?
        Answer: Set the state variable to an empty or null value to 
        clear the value of a controlled component.

      Question 6 : What are the potential downsides of using controlled 
      components?
        Answer: Controlled components can lead to verbose code, 
        especially in forms with many input elements.

 //useState
    By using useState, we are telling React that we want to have a 
 stateful value which changes over time. And whenever this stateful value 
 changes, the affected components (here: Search component) 
 will re-render to use it (here: to display the recent value).

  //Work flow of a useState:
       When the user types into the input field, the input field's change event 
      runs into the event handler. The handler's logic uses the event's value 
      of the target and the state updater function to set the updated state. 
      Afterward, the component re-renders (read: the component function runs). 
      The updated state becomes the current state (here: searchTerm) and is 
      displayed in the component's JSX.

  //Arrow Function
    function getTitle(title) { - convert to arrow function see below
    
    const getTitle =(title) => 
       (
        title
       );

    Eliminate bracket and "return" statement if no business logic before 
    the function - concise
   

  //Arrow function - 
   If there is a business business logic. Otherwise retain the {} and
   put a "return" statement 
     const App = () => {
       ...
       return xyz;
     } 
 
  //How to use a React.Reducer hook 
  To use Reducer (1) first define a reducer function.
     1. A reducer action is always associated with a type. As best 
        practice with a payload.
        Example:
          const storiesReducer = (state, action) =>{
          if (action.type === 'SET_STORIES'){
            //If the type matches a condition in the reducer. Return a new
            //state based on the incoming state and action
            return action.payload;
          }
          else{
          //throw an error if isn't covered by the reducer to remind yourself
          //that the implementation is not covered
            throw new Error();
          }
        }
      2. The second thing to do is to replaceReact.useState to use a reducer hook
         like this: 

          const [stories, dispatchStories] = React.useReducer(storiesReducer,[]);

          1. receives a reducer function called "storiesReducer"
          2. receives an initial state of empty array []
          3. returns an array with 2 item: 
            - The first item is "stories" which is the current state
            - The second item is the updater function named "dispatchStories"
            Unlike useState, the updater function of Reducer sets the state
            "implicitly" by dispatching an "action". Example:
               dispatchStories({
                 type: 'SET_STORIES',   <== this is the action
               payload: result.data.stories,
             });
